# MNIST_NN_fromScratch

# Dataset discription: 
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9

# Feature extraction: 
Centroid feature extraction is applied to the images, which is a point obtained as a weighted average of the pixel coordinates, where the weights are the intensities.

# Classifier:
Neural Network (NN): It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain.
